	<p>Clearly this isn't what you were looking for.</p>
	<p>I mean come on, there is a picture of a sandwich.</p>

		<p>That doesn't even make sense</p>
		<p></p>
		<p>But if you come back later it might make sense, so have a great day!</p>
		<p>WARNING</p>
		<p>Test your version of bash to see if it is vulnerable to the shell shock bug!</p>
		<p>To test run the following in your terminal:</p>
		<p>env x='() { :;}; echo vulnerable' bash -c "echo this is a test"</p>
		<p>If you are vulnerable, "vulnerable" will be one of the lines printed. If you got some error messages, make sure everything is typed right.</p>
